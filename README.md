# 🍷 Pair My Wine — AI Wine & Food Pairing

This project is part of a showcase website for a wine merchant.  
It provides a simple **AI-powered tool** that helps users find the perfect pairing between **wine and food**.

---

## 🧠 How it works

The API uses **OpenAI GPT-4** to generate pairing suggestions.  
Users can enter either a **dish** or a **wine**, and the system returns 3 recommendations:
- a classic pairing  
- a bold pairing  
- a regional (terroir) pairing  

If the AI can’t respond, the app relies on an internal knowledge base (French wine styles and appellations).

## 🚀 What it's used for

- On the client’s website, this feature appears under the page **"Associer mon vin"**  
- It helps visitors discover which dish matches their wine — or which wine to serve with their meal.  
- Designed for **La Boni Cave**, a French wine merchant.
